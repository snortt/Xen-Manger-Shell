# Try to get IP from running VM.
# 
# CAVEAT: 
# Note that this tool uses arp -n to extract the IP.
# If the VM of interest isn't inside ARP table, IP won't be shown.
# This was the first solution that came to my mind. I'm working on another 
# possible way to automatically get IP from a running VM. Any suggestions will be 
# more than welcome ;)
